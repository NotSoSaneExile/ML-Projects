# Project Directory

Welcome to the project directory! This directory contains folders for three different projects: Churn Prediction, Sentiment Analysis, and Rock Paper Scissors game using Computer Vision. Each project folder is designed to organize the necessary files, code, and resources related to its respective project. Here's a brief introduction to each project:

## Churn Prediction
The Churn Prediction project aims to develop a predictive model that can identify customers who are likely to churn, or cancel their subscription or service, in a given time period. The folder for this project contains datasets, code scripts, and any relevant informations required to train and evaluate the churn prediction model.

## Sentiment Analysis
The Sentiment Analysis project focuses on analyzing and classifying the sentiment expressed in a given text, such as customer reviews, social media posts, surveys etc. The project folder includes the necessary resources, such as datasets, models, and code scripts, to perform sentiment analysis tasks.

## Rock Paper Scissors Game using Computer Vision
The Rock Paper Scissors project employs computer vision techniques to build an interactive game of Rock Paper Scissors. By leveraging a webcam or any other suitable video input device, the project allows users to play the game against a computer. The project folder holds the necessary code files, computer vision models, and any additional resources needed to run the game successfully. It may also include a guide or documentation on how to set up and play the game.

Feel free to explore each project folder to learn more about the individual projects and their respective implementations. If you have any questions or need further assistance, please don't hesitate to reach out. Happy coding and exploring!
